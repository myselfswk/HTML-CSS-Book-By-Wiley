        <!--Fixed positioning is a type of absolute positioning that requires the position property to have a value of fixed. It positions the element in
            relation to the browser window. Therefore, when a user scrolls down the page, it stays in the exact same place. It is a good idea to try this
            example in your browser to see the effect-->
        <h1>Position:Fixed</h1>
        <h1 class="Posi-F">Waleed Khan</h1>
        <p class="para-A">My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan. I love my country & Pakistan Zindabad. Pakistan is my Country & I Love Pakistan.</p>

        <!--In normal flow, each block-level element sits on top of the next one. Since this is the default way in which browsers treat HTML elements, you
            do not need a CSS property to indicate that elements should appear in normal flow, but the syntax would be: 
            position: static;
            I have not specified a width property for the heading element, so you can see how it stretches the width of the entire browser window by default.-->
        <h1>Position:Static</h1>
        <div class="div-P-S">
            <h1 class="Posi-H">Waleed Khan</h1>
            <p class="Posi-P">My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan. I love my country & Pakistan Zindabad</p>

        <!--Relative positioning moves an element in relation to where it would have been in normal flow. For example, you can move it 10 pixels lower than
            it would have been in normal flow or 20% to the right. You can indicate that an element should be relatively positioned using the position property
            with a value of relative.-->
        <h1>Position:Relative</h1>
        <h1 class="Posi-H">Waleed Khan</h1>

        <hr />
        <!--When the position property is given a value of absolute, the box is taken out of normal flow and no longer affects the position of other elements on
            the page. (They act like it is not there.) The box offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) specify where the element should appear
            in relation to its containing element.-->
