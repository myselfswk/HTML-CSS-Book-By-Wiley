        <!--There are several types of information that need to be displayed in a grid or table. For example: sports results, stock reports, train
        timetables.-->
        <!--When representing information in a table, you need to think in terms of a grid made up of rows and columns (a bit like a spreadsheet). -->
        <!--A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.-->
        <!--Grids allow us to understand complex data by referencing information on two axes. Each block in the grid is referred to as a table cell. In HTML a
        table is written out row by row.-->
        <h1>Basic Table Structure</h1>
        <!--<table>: The <table> element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.-->
        <!--<tr>: You indicate the start of each row using the opening <tr> tag. (The tr stands for table row.) It is followed by one or more <td> elements
        (one for each cell in that row). At the end of the row you use a closing </tr> tag.-->
        <!--<td>: Each cell of a table is represented using a <td> element. (The td stands for table data.) At the end of each cell you use a closing
        </td> tag.-->
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Waleed</td>
                <td>Huzaifa</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

        <h1>Table Headings</h1>
        <!--The <th> element is used just like the <td> element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands
        for table heading.) -->
        <!--Even if a cell has no content, you should still use a <td> or <th> element to represent the presence of an empty cell otherwise the table will not
        render correctly. -->
        <!--Using <th> elements for headings helps people who use screen readers, improves the ability for search engines to index your pages, and also
        enables you to control the appearance of tables better when you start to use CSS.-->
        <!--You can use the scope attribute on the <th> element to indicate whether it is a heading for a column or a row. It can take the values: row to
        indicate a heading for a row or col to indicate a heading for a column.-->
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th></th>  <!--empty cell is used to fulfil the absence of value-->

        easier for users to see which column the data is in (however this functionality is not implemented by default in any current browser). -->
