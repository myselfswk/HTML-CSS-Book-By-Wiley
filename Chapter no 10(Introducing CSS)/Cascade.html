        <!--If there are two or more rules that apply to the same element, it is important to understand which will take precedence. -->
        <!--Last Rule: If the two selectors are identical, the latter of the two will take precedence. Here you can see the second i selector(on css file)
            takes precedence over the first.-->
        <!--SPECIFICITY: If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
            In this example:  (on css file)
                h1 is more specific than *
                p b is more specific than p
                p#intro is more specific than p-->
        <!--IMPORTANT: You can add !important after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply
            to the same element.-->
