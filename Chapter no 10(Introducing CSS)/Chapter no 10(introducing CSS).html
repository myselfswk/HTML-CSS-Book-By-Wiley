        <!--The key to understanding how CSS works is to imagine that there is an invisible box around every HTML element.-->
        <!--CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.-->
        <!--Boxes: Width and height Borders (color, width, and style) Background color and images Position in the browser window-->
        <!--Text: Typeface, Size, Color Italics, bold, uppercase, lowercase, small-caps-->
        <!--Specific: There are also specific ways in which you can style certain elements such as lists, tables, and forms.-->
        <!--CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
        contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.-->
        <!--  (Example)
            p {
                font-family: Ariel;
            }
        -->
        <!--Selectors: Selectors indicate which element the rule applies to. The same rule can apply to more than one element if you separate the element names
        with commas.-->
        <!--Declarations: Its indicate how the elements referred to in the selector should be styled. Declarations are split into two parts (a property and
        a value), and are separated by a colon.-->
        <!--CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
        several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.-->
        <!--  (Example)
            h1, h2, h3 {
                font-family: Ariel;
                color: yellow;
            }
        -->
        <!--Properties: Its indicate the aspects of the element you want to change. For example, color, font, width, height and border.-->
        <!--Values: Its specify the settings you want to use for the chosen properties. For example, if you want to specify a color property then the value
        is the color you want the text in these elements to be.-->
