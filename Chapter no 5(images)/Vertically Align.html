        <h1>align (additional Information)</h1>
        <p>
            The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image. It has been removed from HTML5
            and new websites should use CSS to control the alignment of images.
        </p>
        <h2>Aligning Images Vertically</h2>
        <p>
            There are three values that the align attribute can take that control how the image should align vertically with the text that surrounds it:
        </p>
        <h4>top</h4>
        <p><img src="images/MyPic.jpg" alt="M Waleed Khan" height="100" width="100" align="top">
            This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the top of the image.
            My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan & I Represent Pakistan. Pakistan Zindabad.
            The value of top places the first line of text near the top of the image and subsequent lines of text appear under the image.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>middle or centre</h4>
        <p><img src="images/MyPic.jpg" alt="M Waleed Khan" height="100" width="100" align="middle">
            This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the middle of the image.
            My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan & I Represent Pakistan. Pakistan Zindabad.
            The value of middle places the first line of text near the vertical middle of the image and subsequent lines of text appear under the image.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>bottom</h4>
        <p><img src="images/MyPic.jpg" alt="M Waleed Khan" height="100" width="100" align="bottom">
            This aligns the first line of the surrounding text with the bottom of the image.
            My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan & I Represent Pakistan. Pakistan Zindabad.
            The value of bottom places the first line of text near the bottom of the image and subsequent lines of text under the image.
