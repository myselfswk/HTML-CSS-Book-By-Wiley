        <h1>Adding Image</h1>
        <h2>Image Tag:</h2>
        <p>
            To add an image into the page you need to use an img tag element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the
            following two attributes:
        </p>
        <h3>1) src</h3>
        <p>
            This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site. 
        </p>
        <h3>2) alt</h3>
        <p>
            This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it. img can't be search by SEO, SEO watch for alt.
        </p>
        <p>
            The text used in the alt attribute is often referred to as alt text. It should give an accurate description of the image content so it can be
            understood by screen reader software (used by people with visual impairments) and search engines.
        </p>
        <h3>title (additional Information)</h3>
        <p>
            You can also use the title attribute with the img tag element to provide additional information about the image. Most browsers will 
            display the content of this attribute in a tootip when the user hovers over the image.
        </p>
        <h4>Example:-</h4>
        <!--height: This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
            width: This specifies the width of the image in pixels.-->
        <img src="images/MyPic.jpg" alt="Muhammad Waleed Khan Picture" title="Wedding Ceremony of Waleed's Friend's Sister" height="500px" width="45%">
        <!--% sign is used for responsiveness of the website, while px is fixed size-->
        <!--we can use images of different website by absolute url, but it may caused effected our website when the url/location of that particular
            website change-->

        <p>My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan & I Represent Pakistan. Pakistan Zindabad</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>2) Inside the start of a paragraph</h3>

            My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan & I Represent Pakistan. Pakistan Zindabad
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>3) In the middle of a paragraph</h3>
        <p>
            My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan & I Represent Pakistan. <img src="images/MyPic.jpg" alt="M Waleed Khan" height="400px" width="40%">

        <h1>Three Rules for Creating Images</h1>
        <p>There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website</p>
        <h2>Save images in the right format</h2>
        <p>Websites mainly use images in jpeg, gif, or png format. If you choose the wrong image format then your image might not look as sharp as it should
            and can make the web page slower to load.</p>
        <h2>Save images at the right size</h2>
        <p>You should save the image at the same width and height it will appear on the website. If the image is smaller than the width or height that you have
            specified, the image can be distorted and stretched. If the image is larger than the width and height if you have specified, the image will take 
            longer to display on the page.</p>
        <h2>Use the correct resolution</h2>
        <p>Computer screens are made up of dots known as pixels. Images used on the web are also made up of tiny dots. Resolution refers to the number of
            dots per inch, and most computer screens only show web pages at 72 pixels per inch. So saving images at a higher resolution results in images
            that are larger than necessary and take longer to download.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1>Figure</h1>
        <p>Images often come with captions. HTML5 has introduced a new figure tag element to contain images and their caption so that the two are associated.
            You can have more than one image inside the figure element as long as they all share the same caption.</p>
        <h1>figcaption</h1>
        <p>The figcaption element has been added to HTML5 in order to allow web page authors to add a caption to an image. Before these elements were created
            there was no way to associate an img tag element with its caption.</p>
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/MyPic.jpg" alt="M Waleed Khan" width="40%" height="400px">
            <br />
            <figcaption>
                My Friend's sister wedding
            </figcaption>
        </figure>
