        <h1>Single Video Source</h1>
        <h1>Video</h1>
        <p>Video tag is used to play videos to your website.The video element has a number of attributes which allow you to control video playback:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>src</h2></li>
            <p>This attribute specifies the path to the video. (The example video is in mp4 format so it will be work in all browsers)</p>
            <li><h2>Poster</h2></li>
            <p>This attribute allows you to specify an image to show while the video is downloading or until the user tells the video to play.</p>
            <li><h2>Width, Height</h2></li>
            <p>These attributes specify the size of the player in pixels.</p>
            <li><h2>Controls</h2></li>
            <p>When used, this attribute indicates that the browser should supply its own controls for playback.</p>
            <li><h2>autoplay</h2></li>
            <p>When used, this attribute specifies that the file should play automatically.</p>
            <li><h2>loop</h2></li>
            <p>When used, this attribute indicates that the video should start playing again once it has ended.</p>
            <li><h2>preload</h2></li>
            <p>This attribute tells the browser what to do when the page loads. It can have one of three values: </p>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>none</h3></li>
                <p>The browser should not load the video until the user presses play.</p>
                <li><h3>auto</h3></li>
                <p>The browser should download the video when the page loads</p>
                <li><h3>metadata</h3></li>
                <p>The browser should just collect information such as the size, first frame, track list, and duration.</p>
            </ol>
        </ul>
        <video src="video/yehToHoga.mp4" poster="images/MyPic.jpg" width="400" height="300" autoplay preload="none" controls loop>

        </video>
        <h1>Multiple Video Source</h1>
        <h2>Source Tag</h2>
        <p>To specify the location of the file to be played, you can use the source element inside the video element. (This should replace the src attribute
            on the opening video tag). You can also use multiple source elements to specify that the video is available in different formats</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>src</h3></li>
            <p>This attribute specifies the path to the video.</p>
            <li><h3>type</h3></li>
            <p>You should use this attribute to tell the browser what format the video is. Otherwise, it will download some of the video to see if it can play
                the file (which will take time and bandwidth).</p>
            <li><h3>codecs</h3></li>
            <p>The codec that was used to encode the video is supplied within the type attribute. Note the use of single quotes, as well as double quotes in
                the type attribute, when it is supplied</p>
            <!--If the browser does not support the <video> element or the format of video used, it will display whatever is between the opening <video>
                and closing </video> tags.-->
        </ol>
        <video poster="images/MyPic.jpg" width="400" height="320" preload="none" controls loop>
            <source src="Video/yehToHoga.mp4" type='video/mp4;codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/>
            <source src="Video/big-buck-bunny_trailer.webm" type='video/webm;codecs="vp8, vorbis"' />
            <!--this second source video is not display top on the webpage because the source tag is used for same videos with different formats
                not for two different videos to be display-->
