        <h1>Understanding Video Formats and Players</h1>
        <p>To add video to your site, there are two key issues to understand: file formats and video players/plugins.</p>
        <h2>Format</h2>
        <p>Movies are available in many formats (BluRay, DVD, VHS, to name a few). Online, there are even more video formats (including AVI, Flash Video,
            H264, MPEG, Ogg Theora, QuickTime, WebM, and Windows Media). In order for users to view your video online, you may need to convert it to another 
            format. The process of converting a video into another format is sometimes referred to as "encoding" the video.</p>
        <h2>Players / pluginS</h2>
        <p>Browsers were initially designed to show text and images only. For this reason, browsers built prior to 2010 generally required another program
            called a player or plugin to to be installed in order to play video content. These players and plugins only supported certain video formats.
            Recently browsers have evolved to support the HTML5 video tag (which renders players and plugins obsolete).</p>
        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>The easiest way to add video to your site is to use a hosted service such as YouTube or Vimeo.
            However, there are some cases where using these services is not appropriate and you will want to host the video on your own site.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1>Using Hosted Video Services</h1>
        <p>The easiest way to add a video to your site is to upload the video to a site like YouTube or Vimeo and use the features provided on their site to
            embed the video in your page.</p>
        <h2>Advantages</h2>
        <p>Hosted video sites (such as YouTube) provide players that work with the majority of web browsers.
            You do not need to worry about encoding your video since these sites allow you to upload your content in a range of formats. Once uploaded, they
            automatically convert your video into the various formats required by different browsers. Web hosting companies often charge extra if you use a
            lot of bandwidth, and video files can be quite large. Therefore, it can cost you extra to host the videos on your own site. If your video is hosted
            on a site like YouTube or Vimeo, however, you do not need to pay for the bandwidth.</p>
        <h2>Disadvantages</h2>
        <p>Your video will be available on the site of the hosted service, so if you want the content to be exclusively available on your site (and not 
            visible on other sites), you need to host the video on your own server and add your own player into the page. Some services will limit what your
            video is allowed to include. For example, most prohibit the use of advertising within the video you upload (which prevents you from monetizing
            that content). Some hosted services will play their own adverts before your video will begin, or even overlay them over the screen as your video
            is playing. The quality of video on some hosted services can also be limited.</p>
        <h2>The Alternative</h2>
        <p>If you want to host video on your own site - rather than a hosted service - a lot more work is involved in setting up your site to play the video.
            We will be looking at two different ways that you can host your own videos: using both Flash Video and the HTML5 video>element. In order to
            ensure that the maximum number of visitors to your site can see the video, you will need to use a combination of both of these techniques.</p>

        <h1>Preparing a Flash Video for Your Site</h1>
        <ol>
            <p>There are three steps you need to follow to add a Flash Video to your web page:</p>
            <li><h3>Convert Your Video into FLV Format</h3></li>
            <p>To play a Flash Video, you need to convert your video into FLV format. Since Flash 6, the Flash authoring environment has come with a Flash
                Video Encoder to convert videos into FLV format. Some Flash video players also support a format called H264 (and some video editing programs
                export video in this format).</p>
            <li><h3>FinD an FLV Player to Play the Video</h3></li>
            <p>You'll need a player written in Flash to play the FLV file. Its purpose is to hold the FLV movie and add controls such as play/pause. Here are
                two sites that offer FLV players:</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.osflv.com">OSFlv</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://www.jwplayer.com/">JWPlayer</a></p>
            <p>You do not need the Flash authoring environment to use either of these on your website.</p>
            <li><h3>Include the Player & Video in Your Page</h3></li>
            <p>You can include the player in your page using a JavaScript technique such as SWFObject. you will also need to tell the player where it can
                find the video file that you want it to play. (Some players have advanced features such as the ability to create playlists of multiple videos
                or add a still picture before the video plays.)</p>
        </ol>
