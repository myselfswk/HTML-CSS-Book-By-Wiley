        <h1>Adding Audio to your Webpages</h1>
        <p>By far the most popular format for putting audio on web pages is MP3. As with video, there are three routes commonly taken:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h2>Use a Hosted Service</h2></li>
            <p>There are several sites that allow you to upload your audio, and provide a player which you can embed in your page, such as</p>
            <p><a href="https://soundcloud.com/discover">SoundCloud</a></p>
            <p><a href="https://myspace.com/">MySpace</a></p>
            <li><h2>Use Flash</h2></li>
            <p>There are several Flash movies that allow you to play MP3 files; from simple buttons that play one track to complex players that allow you
                to create playlists and juke boxes</p>
            <li><h2>Use HTML5</h2></li>
            <p>HTML5 has introduced a new audio element. Browsers that support this element provide their own controls â€” much as they do for the video
                files we just looked at</p>
        </ul>
        <p>There are many MP3 players that have already been written in Flash, such as:</p>
        <p><a href="https://flash-mp3-player.net">flash-mp3-player.net</a></p>
        <p><a href="musicplayer.sourceforge.net">musicplayer.sourceforge.net</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.wimpyplayer.com/">www.wimpyplayer.com</a></p>
        <div id="music-player">   <!--some missing file or updates-->
            <p>You cannot hear this track because this
            browser does not support our Flash music
            player.</p>
        </div>
        <h1>Adding HTML5 Audio to Your Pages</h1>
        <h2>Audio Tag</h2>
        <p>HTML5 introduced the audio element to include audio files in your pages. As with HTML5 video, browsers expect different formats for the audio.
            The audio element has a number of attributes which allow you to control audio playback:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>src</h3></li>
            <p>This attribute specifies the path to the audio file.</p>
            <li><h3>controls</h3></li>
            <p>This attribute indicates whether the player should display controls. If you do not use this attribute, no controls will be shown by default.
                You can also specify your own controls using JavaScript.</p>
            <li><h3>autoplay</h3></li>
            <p>The presence of this attribute indicates that the audio should start playing automatically. (It is considered better practice to let visitors
                choose to play audio.)</p>
            <li><h3>preload</h3></li>
            <p>This attribute indicates what the browser should do if the player is  not set to autoplay. It can have the same values we saw on video
                element.</p>
            <li><h3>loop</h3></li>
            <p>This attribute specifies that the audio track should play again once it has finished.</p>
        </ul>
        <audio src="audio/01 - Aaj Dil Shayarana.mp3" controls autoplay>
            <p>This browser does not support our audio format.</p>
        </audio>
        <!--if any browser can't support the format type that your uploaded file have than, you can upload multiple source file with different format-->
        <h1>Multiple Audio Sources</h1>
        <h2>Source Tag</h2>
        <p>It is possible to specify more than one audio file using the source element between the opening audio and closing audio tags (instead of the
            src attribute on the opening audio tag). This is important because different browsers support different formats for audio files</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>src</h3></li>
            <p>The source element uses the src attribute to indicate where the audio file is located.</p>
            <li><h3>type</h3></li>
            <p>At the time of writing, the type attribute was not commonly being used on the source element in the same way it was for the video element.</p>
        </ul>
        <audio controls autoplay>
            <source src="audio/Demo.ogg" />
            <source src="audio/01 - Aaj Dil Shayarana.mp3" />
            <p>This browser does not support our audio format.</p>
        </audio>
