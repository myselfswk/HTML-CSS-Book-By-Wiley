            <h1>Magnolia</h1>
            <p>Magnolia grandiflora, commonly known as the Southern magnolia or bull bay, is a tree of the family Magnoliaceae native to the southeastern
                United States, from coastal Virginia south to central Florida, and west to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. Reaching 27.5 m (90 ft) in height,
                it is a large striking evergreen tree with large dark green leaves and large white fragrant flowers. Widely cultivated around the world,
                over a hundred cultivars have been bred and marketed commercially. The timber is hard and heavy, and has been used commercially to make
                furniture, pallets, and veneer.</p>
            <h1>Ranunculus</h1>
            <p><b><i> asiaticus (Persian Buttercup)</i></b> is a species of buttercup (Ranunculus) native to the eastern Mediterranean region in
                southwestern Asia, southeastern Europe (Crete, Karpathos and Rhodes), and northeastern Africa. It is a herbaceous perennial plant growing to
                45 cm tall, with simple or branched stems. The basal leaves are three-lobed, with leaves higher on the stems more deeply divided; like the
                stems, they are downy or hairy. The flowers are 3-5 cm diameter, variably red to pink, yellow, or white, with one to several flowers on each
                stem.</p>
            <h1>Tulipa</h1>
            <p><b><i>Tulipa gesneriana L. or "Didier's tulip"</i></b> is a plant belonging to the family of Liliaceae. This species has uncertain origins,
                possibly from Asia, and has become naturalised in south-west Europe. Most of the cultivated species, subspecies and cultivars of tulip are
                derived from Tulipa gesneriana. The flower and bulb can cause dermatitis through the allergen, tuliposide A, even though the bulbs may be
                consumed with little ill-effect. The sweet-scented bisexual flowers appear during April and May. Bulbs are extremely resistant to frost,
                and can tolerate temperatures well below freezing - a period of low temperature is necessary to induce proper growth and flowering, triggered
                by an increase in sensitivity to the phytohormone auxin. The bulbs may be dried and pulverised and added to cereals or flour.</p>

            1: background-color

            CSS3 will also support the use of multiple background images by repeating the background shorthand. Because few browsers supported this property
            at the time of writing, it was not commonly used.
