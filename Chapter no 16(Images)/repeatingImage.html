        <div>
            <p>The background-repeat property can have four values:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>repeat</b> The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically (the default way it is shown if the background-repeat
                    property isn't used).</li>
                <li><b>repeat-x</b> The image is repeated horizontally only</li>
                <li><b>repeat-y</b> The image is repeated vertically only.</li>
                <li><b>no-repeat</b> The image is only shown once. The background-attachment property specifies whether a background image should stay in
                    one position or move as the user scrolls up and down the page. It can have one of two values:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>fixed</b> The background image stays in the same position on the page.</li>
                    <li><b>scroll</b> The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
