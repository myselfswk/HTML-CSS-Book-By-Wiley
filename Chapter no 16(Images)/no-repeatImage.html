                it is a large striking evergreen tree with large dark green leaves and large white fragrant flowers. Widely cultivated around the world, over
                a hundred cultivars have been bred and marketed commercially. The timber is hard and heavy, and has been used commercially to make furniture,
                pallets, and veneer.</p>
