            <p>Magnolia grandiflora, commonly known as the Southern magnolia or bull bay, is a tree of the family Magnoliaceae native to the southeastern
                United States, from coastal Virginia south to central Florida, and west to eastern Texas and Oklahoma. Reaching 27.5 m (90 ft) in height,
                it is a large striking evergreen tree with large dark green leaves and large white fragrant flowers. Widely cultivated around the world,
                over a hundred cultivars have been bred and marketed commercially. The timber is hard and heavy, and has been used commercially to make
                furniture, pallets, and veneer.</p>
