        <h1>Centering Content</h1>
        <p>If you want to center a box on the page (or center it inside the element that it sits in), you can set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.</p>
        <p>In order to center a box on the page, you need to set a width for the box (otherwise it will take up the full width of the page).</p>
        <p>Once you have specified the width of the box, setting the left and right margins to auto will make the browser put an equal gap on each side
            of the box. This centers the box on the page (or within the element that the box sits inside).</p>
        <p>In order for this to work in older browsers (particularly IE6), the element that the box sits inside should have a text-align property with its
            value set to center. </p>
        <p>When you specify the width of a box, any padding or margin should be added to the width of it. Internet Explorer 6, however, has a quirk whereby
            it includes the padding and margins in the width of the box.</p>
