        <!--Till yet we use tags by which user can only see the content but he/she can't interact with webpages. Forms provides us the way by which 
        we can interact with users-->
        <!--forms can also used to transfer the data to a server/database from the webpages-->
        <!--Traditionally, the term 'form' has referred to a printed document that contains spaces for you to fill in information.
            HTML borrows the concept of a form to refer to different elements that allow you to collect information from visitors to your site.-->
        <!--Whether you are adding a simple search box to your website or you need to create more complicated insurance applications, HTML forms give you
        a set of elements to collect data from your users. -->
        <!--Why Forms?-->
        <!--The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage.-->
        <!--In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online. You will see forms when registering as a 
        member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists-->
        <dl>
            <dt><b>Form Controls:</b></dt>
            <dd>
                There are several types of form controls that you can use to collect information from visitors to your site.
            </dd>
            <h1>Form Structure:-</h1>
        <!--<form>: Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action attribute and will usually have a method 
        and id attribute too.-->
        <!--action: Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the server that will receive the information
            in the form when it is submitted-->
        <!--method: Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.
            With the get method, the values from the form are added to the end of the URL specified in the action attribute. The get method is ideal for:
            >> short forms (such as search boxes)
            >> when you are just retrieving data from the web server (not sending information that should be added to or deleted from a database)
            With the post method the values are sent in what are known as HTTP headers. As a rule of thumb you should use the post method if your form:
            >> allows users to upload a file
            >> is very long
            >> contains sensitive data (e.g. passwords)
            >> adds information to, or deletes information from, a database
        -->
        <h1>How Forms Work</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>A user fills in a form and then presses a button to submit the information to the server.</li>
            <li>The name of each form control is sent to the server along with the value the user enters or selects.</li>
            <li>The server processes the information using a programming language such as PHP, C#, VB.net, or Java. It may also store the information in a
                database.</li>
            <li>The server creates a new page to send back to the browser based on the information received.</li>
            <!--A form may have several form controls, each gathering different information. The server needs to know which piece of inputted data 
                corresponds with which form element.-->
            <!--To differentiate between various pieces of inputted data, information is sent from the browser to the server using name/value pairs. -->
            <!--If the form control allows the user to enter text, then the value of the form control is whatever the user has typed in.-->
            <!--If the form control allows you to choose from a fixed set of answers (e.g. radio buttons, checkboxes or a drop down list), the web page
                author will add code that gives each option an automatic value.-->
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <form method="get">   <!--action="http://www.example.com/subscribe.php" -->

        <h1>HTML5</h1>
        <h2>Form Validation:-</h2>
        <p>You have probably seen forms on the web that give users messages if the form control has not been filled in correctly; this is known as form
            validation.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, form validation has been performed using JavaScript. But HTML5 is introducing validation and leaving the work to the browser</p>
        <form method="post"> <!-- action="http://www.example.com/login/" -->
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <!--required="required" is used to validate text filled when it is empty-->
            <input type="text" name="username" required="required" /><br />
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <input type="password" name="password" required="required" />
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
        </form>
        <h2>Date Input:-</h2>
        <p>Many forms need to gather information such as dates, email addresses, and URLs. This has traditionally been done using text inputs.
            HTML5 introduces new form controls to standardize the way that some information is gathered. Older browsers that do not recognize these inputs
            will just treat them as a single line text box.<br />type="date"<br />If you are asking the user for a date, you can use an input element
            and give the type attribute a value of date. This will create a date input in browsers that support the new HMTL5 input types.</p>
        <form method="post">  <!-- action="http://www.example.com/bookings/"-->
            <label for="username">Departure date:</label>
            <input type="date" name="depart" />
            <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
        </form>
        <h2>Email & URL Input:-</h2>
        <p>HTML5 has also introduced inputs that allow visitors to enter email addresses and URLs. Browsers that do not support these input types will
            just treat them as text boxes.<br />type="email"<br />If you ask a user for an email address, you can use the email input. Browsers that support
            HTML5 validation will check that the user has provided information in the correct format of an email address. Some smart phones also optimize their
            keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to need when entering an email address (such as the @ symbol).<br />type="url"<br />
            A URL input can be used when you are asking a user for a web page address. Browsers that support HTML5 validation will check that the user has
            provided information in the format of a URL. Some smart phones also optimize their keyboard to display the keys you are most likely to need 
            when entering a URL.</p>

            To create the HTML5 search box the input element should have a type attribute whose value is search. Older browsers will simply treat it like a
