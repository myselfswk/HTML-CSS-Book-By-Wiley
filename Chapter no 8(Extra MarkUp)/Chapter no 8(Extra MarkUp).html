        <h2>Olafur Eliasson</h2>
        <!-- end of introduction -->
        <!-- start of main text -->
        <p>Olafur Eliasson was born in Copenhagen, Denmark in 1967 to Icelandic parents.</p>
        <p>He is known for sculptures and large-scale  installation art employing elemental materials  such as light, water, and air temperature to
         enhance the viewer's experience.</p>

        <h1>ID Attribute:-</h1>
        <!--Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should
            start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have
            the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique).-->
        <p>My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan</p>
        <p id="pullquote">My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan <span>(without css file, this id is worthless)</span></p>
        <!--without css file, this id is worthless-->
        <p>My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan</p>
        <h1>Class Attribute:-</h1>
        <!--Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a
        way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. -->
        <p class="important">My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan</p>
        <p>My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan <span>(without css file, these classes are worthless)</span></p>   <!--without css file, these classes are worthless-->
        <p class="important admittance">My Name is Muhammad Waleed Khan</p>
        <hr />
        <h1>Block Elements</h1>
        <p>Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. </p>
        <!--Examples of block elements are <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.-->
        <h3>Example:-</h3>
        <h1>Hiroshi Sugimoto</h1>
        <p>The dates for the ORIGIN OF ART exhibition are as  follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Science: 21 Nov - 20 Feb 2010/11</li>
            <li>Architecture: 6 Mar - 15 May 2011</li>
            <li>History: 29 May - 21 Aug 2011</li>
            <li>Religion: 28 Aug - 6 Nov 2011</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Inline Elements</h1>
        <p>Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.</p>
        <!--Examples of inline elements are <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.-->
        <h3>Example:-</h3>
        <p>Timed to a single revolution of the planet around the sun at a 23.4 degrees tilt that plays out the rhythm of the seasons, this <em>Origins of
            Art</em> cycle is organized around four themes: <b>science, architecture, history</b> and <b>religion</b>.</p>
        <hr />
        <h1>Grouping Text & Elements In a Block</h1>
        <h2>Div Tag:-</h2>
        <p>The div element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. Div is the block element and it dowsn't have visible
            view. In a browser, the contents of the div element will start on a new line, but other than this it will make no difference to the presentation
            of the page. It can also make it easier to follow your code if you have used div elements to hold each section of the page.</p>
        <p>Picture and unordered lines are includes in the div tag.</p>
        <div id="header">  <!--we can perform some task of this div using id="header" by css-->
            <img src="Images/MyPic.jpg" alt="Muhammad Waleed Khan" width="40%" height="400px"/>

        <h1>Grouping Text & Elements Inline</h1>
        <h2>Span:-</h2>
        <p>The span element acts like an inline equivalent of the div element. It is used to either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text</li>
            <li>Contain a number of inline elements, span can be used in paragraph tags</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example:-</h3>
        <p>Anish Kapoor won the Turner Prize in 1991 and exhibited at the <span class="gallery">Tate Modern</span> gallery in London in 2003.</p>
        <!--without css file, this class="gallery" is worthless-->
        <!--The most common reason why people use <span> elements is so that they can control the appearance of the content of these elements using CSS.-->
        <hr />
        <h2>IFrames</h2>
        <p>An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page â€” and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation
            of inline frame. One common use of iframes (that you may have seen on various websites) is to embed a Google Map into a page. </p>
        <p>The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web).</p>
        <iframe width="450" height="350" src="https://www.google.com/maps?q=moma+new+york&amp;output=embed"></iframe>
        <!--src: the src attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.
            height: The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels.
            width: The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe in pixels.-->
        <hr />
        <!--scrolling: The scrolling attribute will not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the iframe should have scrollbars or
            not. This is important if the page inside the iframe is larger than the space you have allowed for it (using the height and width attributes).
            Scrollbars allow the user to move around the frame to see more content. It can take one of three values: yes (to show scrollbars), no (to hide
            scrollbars) and auto (to show them only if needed).-->
        <iframe src="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=moma+new+york&amp;output=embed" width="450" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        <!--frameborder: The frameborder attribute will not be supported in HTML5. In HTML 4 and XHTML, it indicates whether the frame should have a border
            or not. A value of 0 indicates that no border should be shown. A value of 1 indicates that a border should be shown.-->
        <!--seamless: In HTML5, a new attribute called seamless can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars are not desired. The seamless attribute (like
            some other new HTML5 attributes) does not need a value, but you will often see authors give it a value of seamless. Older browsers don't support
            the seamless attribute. Seamless Should remove frameborder & scrollbar-->
        <h1>Information About Your Pages</h1>
        <h2>meta tags:-</h2>
        <p>The meta element lives inside the head element and contains information about that web page. It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of
            purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive,
            it can be set to expire).The meta element is an empty element so it does not have a closing tag. It uses attributes to carry the information.</p>
        <!--The most common attributes are the name and content attributes, which tend to be used together. These attributes specify properties of the entire
            page. The value of the name attribute is the property you are setting, and the value of the content attribute is the value that you want to give
            to this property-->
        <ul>
            <img src="Images/metaTag.PNG" alt="Information About MetaTag" style="float: right;">
            <li><h3>description</h3></li>
            <p>This contains a description of the page. This description is commonly used by search engines to understand what the page is about and should be a
                maximum of 155 characters. Sometimes it is also displayed in search engine results</p>
            <li><h3>Keywords</h3></li>
            <p>This contains a list of commaseparated words that a user might search on to find the page. In practice, this no longer has any noticeable
                effect on how search engines index your site.</p>
            <li><h3>robots</h3></li>
            <p>This indicates whether search engines should add this page to their search results or not. A value of noindex can be used if this page should
                not be added. A value of nofollow can be used if search engines should add this page in their results but not any pages that it links to.</p>
            <li><h3>Author</h3></li>
            <p>This defines the author of the web page.</p>
            <li><h3>Pragma</h3></li>
            <p>This prevents the browser from caching the page. (That is, storing it locally to save time downloading it on subsequent visits.)</p>
            <li><h3>Expires</h3></li>
            <p>Because browsers often cache the content of a page, the expires option can be used to indicate when the page should expire (and no longer be
                cached). Note that the date must be specified in the format shown</p>
        </ul>
        <hr />
        <ul>
            <img src="Images/Characters.PNG" alt="escape characters" style="float: right;">
            <h1>Escape Characters</h1>
            <p>There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code. (For example, the left and right angled brackets.)</p>
            <li>Therefore, if you want these characters to appear on your page you need to use what are termed "escape" characters (also known as escape codes or
                entity references). For example, to write a left angled bracket, you can use either &lt; or &#60;. For an ampersand, you can use either &amp;
                or &#38;
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>There are also special codes that can be used to show symbols such as copyright and trademark, currency symbols, mathematical characters, and
                some punctuation marks. For example, if you want to include a copyright symbol on a web page you can use either &copy; or &#169;.
            </li>
            <br />
            <li>When using escape characters, it is important to check the page in your browser to ensure that the correct symbol shows up. This is because
                some fonts do not support all of these characters and you might therefore need to specify a different font for these characters in your CSS code.
            </li>
