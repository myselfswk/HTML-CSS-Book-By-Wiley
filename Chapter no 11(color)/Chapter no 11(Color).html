        <h1>FOREGROUND COLOR</h1>
        <h2>Color</h2>
        <p>The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><h3>RGB Value:</h3></li>
            <p>These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. <p>example: rgb(100,100,90)</p></p>
            <li><h3>HEX Code:</h3></li>
            <p>These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.
                <p>For example: #ee3e80</p></p>
            <li><h3>Color Name:</h3></li>
            <p>There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.</p><p>For example: DarkCyan</p><p>We look at these three different ways of
                specifying colors on the next double-page spread</p>
            <!--The use of comments can help you to understand a CSS file (and organise it, by splitting a long document into sections). Here, we have used
                comments to indicate which method is used to specify each of the different types of colors-->
        </ol>

        <h1>BACKGROUND COLOR</h1>
        <h2>background-color</h2>
        <p>CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.<br />
            You can specify your choice of background color in the same three ways you can specify foreground colors: RGB values, hex codes, and color names</p>
        <p>If you do not specify a background color, then the background is transparent. </p>
        <!--By default, most browser windows have a white background, but browser users can set a background color for their windows, so if you want to be
            sure that the background is white you can use the background-color property on the <body> element.-->
        <!--Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.-->
        <!--Hue: Hue is near to the colloquial idea of color. Technically speaking however, a color can also have saturation and brightness as well as hue.-->
        <!--Saturation: Saturation refers to the amount of gray in a color. At maximum saturation, there would be no gray in the color. At minimum saturaation,
            the color would be mostly gray.-->
        <!--Brightness: Brightness (or "value") refers to how much black is in a color. At maximum brightness, there would be no black in the color.
            At minimum brightness, the color would be very dark.-->
        
        <!--Contrast: When picking foreground and background colors, it is important to ensure that there is enough contrast for the text to be legible.-->
        <!--Text is harder to read when there is low contrast between background and foreground colors.
            A lack of contrast is particularly a problem for those with visual impairments and color blindness-->
        <!--Text is easier to read when there is higher contrast between background and foreground colors.
            If you want people to read a lot of text on your page, however, then too much contrast can make it harder to read, too.-->
        <!--For long spans of text, reducing the contrast a little bit improves readability.
            You can reduce contrast by using dark gray text on a white background or an off-white text on a dark background-->
