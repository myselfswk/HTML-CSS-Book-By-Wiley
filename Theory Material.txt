<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Chapter no 1>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> (Structure)

>> Understanding structure
>> Learning about markup
>> Tags and elements

html is a language which defines the basic structure of a website.
The HTML code is made up of characters that live inside angledbrackets — these are called HTML elements. Elements are usually made up of two tags: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

<body>: Everything inside body element/tag is shown inside the main browser window.
<head>: This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window.
<title>: The contents of the <title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).
Anything written between the <title> tags will appear in the title bar (or tabs) at the top of the browser window.

The HyperText part refers to the fact that HTML allows you to create links that allow visitors to move from one
page to another quickly and easily.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<Chapter no 2>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> (Text)

>> Headings and paragraphs
>> Bold, italic, emphasis
>> Structural and semantic markup
Tags/element is also known as markups, to the content of the page.

>> Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs
>> Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on

The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly.
By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.

<b>: By enclosing words in the tags <b> and </b> we can make characters appear bold.
<i>: By enclosing words in the tags <i> and </i> we can make characters appear italic.
<sup>: The <sup> element is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffixes of dates or mathematical concepts like raising a number to a power such as 22.
<sub>: The <sub> element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with foot notes or chemical formulas such as H20.

When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other, it only displays one space. Similarly if it comes across a line break, it treats that as a single space too. This is known as white space collapsing.
Empty Element: Self Closing Tags, or Stand alone tags, single tags can also run without forward slash.

<br/>: As you have already seen, the browser will automatically show each new paragraph or heading on a new line. But if you wanted to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag,
that is <br />. br stands for break.

<hr/>: To create a break between themes — such as a change of topic in a book or a new scene in a play — you can add a horizontal rule between sections using the <hr /> tag. hr stands for horizontal rule.

There are a few elements that do not have any words between an opening and closing tag. They are known as empty elements and they are written differently. An empty element usually has only one tag. Before the closing angled bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character.
html don't have semantics attributes, it has grammer language language as semantics like where/how to use bold/em tags in our page.

<strong>: The use of the <strong> element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis. By default, browsers will show the contents of a <strong> element in bold.

<em>: The <em> element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence. By default browsers will show the contents of an <em> element in italic.

<blockquote>: The <blockquote> element is used for longer quotes that take up an entire paragraph. Notehow the <p> element is still used inside the <blockquote> element.
Browsers tend to indent the contents of the <blockquote> element, however you should not use this element just to indent a piece of text — rather you should achieve this effect using CSS.

<q>: The <q> element is used for shorter quotes that sit within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <q> element, however Internet Explorer does not — therefore many people avoid using the <q> element.
Both elements may use the cite attribute to indicate where the quote is from. Its value should be a URL that will have more information about the source of the quotation.

<abbr>: If you use an abbreviation or an acronym, then the <abbr> element can be used. A title attribute on the opening tag is used to specify the full term. In HTML 4 there was a separate <acronym> element for acronyms. To spell out the full form of the acronym, the title attribute was used (as with the <abbr> element above). HTML5
just uses the <abbr> element for both abbreviations and acronyms.

<cite>: When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, the <cite> element can be used to indicate where the citation is from.
In HTML5, <cite> should not really be used for a person's name — but it was allowed in HTML 4, so most people are likely to continue to use it. Browsers will render the content of a <cite> element in italics.
The name of the people isn't define is the cite tag but the work of the people do so.

<dfn>: The first time you explain some new terminology (perhaps an academic concept or some jargon) in a document, it is known as the defining instance of it.
The <dfn> element is used to indicate the defining instance of a new term. Some browsers show the content of the <dfn> element in italics. Safari do not change its appearance.

<address>: The <address> element has quite a specific use: to contain contact details for the author of the page. It can contain a physical address, but it does not have to. For example, it may also contain a phone number or email address. Browsers often display the content of the <address> element in italics.

<ins>: The <ins> element can be used to show content that has been inserted into a document.
<del>: the <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.
The content of a <ins> element is usually underlined, while the content of a <del> element usually has a line through it.

<s>: The <s> element indicates something that is no longer accurate or relevant (but that should not be deleted). Visually the content of an <s> element will usually be displayed with a line through the center. Older versions of HTML had a <u> element for content that was underlined, but this is being phased out.
