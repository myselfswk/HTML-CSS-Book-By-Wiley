        <!--Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand
            who your target audience is.-->
        <!--It can be helpful to ask some questions about the people you would expect to be interested in the subject of your site.
            If you ask a client who a site is for, it is not uncommon for them to answer "the entire world." Realistically, it is unlikely to be relevant to
            everyone. If your site sells light bulbs, even though most people using a computer probably use light bulbs, they are not likely to order them from
            someone in a different country.-->
        <!--Invent some fictional visitors from your typical target audience. They will become your friends. They can influence design decisions from color
            palettes to level of detail in descriptions.-->
        <!--Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website,
            most will visit for a specific reason.-->
        <!--Your content and design should be influenced by the goals of your users. To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two
            basic categories of questions you can ask:
            1: The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.
            2: The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now.-->
        <!--Key Motivations:
            >> Are they looking for general entertainment or do they need to achieve a specific goal?
            >> If there is a specific goal, is it a personal or professional one?
            >> Do they see spending time on this activity as essential or a luxury?-->
        <!--It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
            information can help guide your site designs.-->
        <!--First you want to create a list of reasons why people would be coming to your site. You can then assign the list of tasks to the fictional
            visitors you created in the step described on the previous page.-->
        <!--What Information Your Visitors Need:
                You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve
                their goals quickly and effectively.-->
        <!--You may want to offer additional supporting information that you think they might find helpful. Look at each of the reasons why people will be
            visiting your site and determine what they need to achieve their goals. You can prioritize levels of information from key points down to
            non-essential or background information. By ensuring that you provide the information that your visitors are looking for, they will consider
            your site more relevant to them. -->
        <!--How Often People Will Visit Your Site:
                Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other
                content remains relatively static-->
        <!--A website about fashion trends will need to change a lot more frequently than one that is promoting a service that people do not buy regularly
            (such as domestic plumbing or double glazing).-->
        <h1>Site Maps</h1>
        <p>Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.</p>
        <p>The aim is to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site. This is known as a site map and it will show how those
            pages can be grouped.</p>
        <p>To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting</p>
        <!--This involves placing each piece of information that a visitor might need to know on a separate piece of paper and then organizing the related
            information into groups.-->
        <!--Each group relates to a page and, on larger sites the, pages can in turn can be grouped together to create different sections of the website.
            The groups of information are then turned into the diagram that is known as the site map. Sometimes it can be helpful to ask people who are the
            target audience to help you group related information together-->
        <!--A site map will usually begin with the homepage. Additionally, if the site is large and is compartmentalized into sections, each section
            might require its own section homepage to link to all of the information within it.-->

        <h1>WireFrames</h1>
        <p>A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information & how
            much space it might require.</p>
        <!--A lot of designers will take the elements that need to appear on each page and start by creating wireframes. This involves sketching or shading
            areas where each element of the page will go (such as the logo, primary navigation, headings and main bodies of text, user logins etc).
            By creating a wireframe you can ensure that all of the information that needs to be on a page is included.-->
        <!--You should not include the color scheme, font choices, backgrounds or images for the website in the wireframe. It should focus on what information
            needs to be on each page and create a visual hierarchy to indicate the most important parts of each page.-->
        <!--The wireframes make design easier because you know what information needs to appear on which page before considering how the the page should look.
            It can be very helpful to show the wireframes of a site to a client before showing them a design. It enables the client to ensure the site has all
            the functions and information it needs to offer.-->
        <h2>Example WireFrame</h2>

        <!--Getting your message across using design:
                The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand
                its importance and what order to read it in.-->
        <!--CONTENT: Web pages often have a lot of information to communicate. For example, the pages of online newspapers will have information that does
            not appear on every page of the print equivalent-->
        <!--Prioritizing: If everything on a page appeared in the same style, it would be much harder to understand. (Key messages would not stand out.)
            By making parts of the page look distinct from surrounding content, designers draw attention to (or away from) those items.-->
        <!--Organizing: Grouping together related content into blocks or chunks makes the page look simpler (and easier to understand). Users should be able to
            identify the purpose of each block without processing each individual item. By presenting certain types of information in a similar visual style
            (such as using the same style for all buttons or all links), users will learn to associate that style with a particular type of content.-->
        <!--visual hierarchy: Attention is immediately drawn to a picture that shows the service this company offers and a headline to explain it. The size
            and colored background reinforce that this is the primary message on the page.-->
        <!--Grouping: There are several chunks of information on this page. At the top you can see the logo and navigation. Under this is the information that
            introduces the company's services. Further down are three distinct groups showing you what the services do, the costs involved and some of
            the services' users.-->
