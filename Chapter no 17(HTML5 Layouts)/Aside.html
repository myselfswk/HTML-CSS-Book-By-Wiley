        <h1>Aside & Sections</h1>
        <h2>aside section</h2>
        <!--The <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not. When the <aside> element is used inside an
            <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a
            pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.-->
        <!--When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example,
            it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.-->
        <aside>
            <!--The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading-->
            <!--For example, on a homepage there may be several <section> elements to contain different sections of the page, such as latest news,
                top products, and newsletter signup.-->
            <!--Because the <section> element groups related items together, it may contain several distinct <article> elements that have a common theme or
                purpose. Alternatively, if you have a page with a long article, the <section> element can be used to split the article up into separate
                sections.-->
