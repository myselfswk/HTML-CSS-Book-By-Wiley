        <h1>Article, Figure, Figcaption & HGroup</h1>
        <!--The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
            This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content.-->
        <!--If a page contains several articles (or even summaries of several articles), then each individual article would live inside its own <article> element.
            The <article> elements can even be nested inside each other. For example, a blog post might live inside one <article> element and each comment on
            the article could live inside its own child <article> element.-->
        <article>
            <!--figure can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images). -->
            <!--It is important to note that the article should still make sense if the content of the <figure> element were moved (to another part of the
                page, or even to a different page altogether). -->
            <!--For this reason, it should only be used when the content simply references the element (and not for something that is absolutely integral to
                the flow of a page). 
                Examples of usage include:
                >> Images
                >> Videos
                >> Graphs
                >> Diagrams
                >> Code samples
                >> Text that supports the main body of an article-->

                <figcaption>Flower</figcaption>
                <!--The <figure> element should also contain a <figcaption> element which provides a text decription for the content of the <figure> element. In
                    this example, you can see a <figure> has been added inside the <article> element.-->
            </figure>
            <!--The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one
                single heading. For example, the <hgroup> element could be used to contain both a title inside an <h2> element and a subtitle within an
                <h3> element.-->
            <hgroup>
                <h2>Flower</h2>
                <h3>Beautiful Flower</h3>
            </hgroup>
