        <!--The properties that allow you to control the appearance of text can be split into two groups:-->
        <!--Those that directly affect the font and its appearance (including the typeface, whether it is regular, bold or italic, and the size of the text)
            Those that would have the same effect on text no matter what font you were using (including the color of text and the spacing between words and
            letters)-->
        <!--Typeface Terminology-->
        <!--Serif: Serif fonts have extra details on the ends of the main strokes of the letters. These details are known as serifs-->
        <!--Sans-Serif: Sans-serif fonts have straight ends to letters, and therefore have a much cleaner design-->
        <!--Monospace: Every letter in a monospace (or fixed-width) font is the same width. (Non-monospace fonts have different widths.)-->
        <!--Cursive: Cursive fonts either have joining strokes or other cursive characteristics, such as handwriting styles.-->
        <!--Fantasy: Fantasy fonts are usually decorative fonts and are often used for titles. They're not designed for long bodies of text.-->
        <h1>Specifying Typefaces</h1>
        <h2>font-family</h2>  <!--h1, h2 have same size because of css font-size-->
        <p class="para">The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies.
            The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use. The people who are visiting your site need the typeface you have
            specified installed on their computer in order for it to be displayed.</p>
        <!--You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that, if the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed, the browser can
            try to use an alternative font from the list.-->
        <h2>font-size</h2>
        <p>The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The
            most common are:</p>
        <p>Note:- (Text Size is smaller because of css file have font-size attribute '12px')</p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Pixels:</h3></li>
            <p>Pixels are commonly used because they allow web designers very precise control over how much space their text takes up. The number of pixels is
                followed by the letters px.</p>
            <li><h3>Percentages:</h3></li>
            <p>The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of 75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px.</p>
        </ul>
        <h2>@font-face</h2>
        <p class="paraOne">@font-face allows you to use a font, even if it is not installed on the computer of the person browsing, by allowing you to specify a path to a
            copy of the font, which will be downloaded if it is not on the user's machine.</p>
        <p class="paraOne">Because this technique allows a version of the font to be downloaded to the user's computer, it is important that the license for the font permits
            it to be used in this way. You add the font to your style sheet using the @font-face rule, as shown on the right. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>font-family:</h3></li>
            <p>This specifies the name of the font. This name can then be used as a value of the font-family property in the rest of the style sheet (as shown
                in the rule for the h1 and h2 elements)</p>
            <p>Note:- (Text Size is smaller because of css file have font-size attribute '12px')</p>
            <li><h3>src:</h3></li>
            <p>This specifies the path to the font. In order for this technique to work in all browsers, you will probably need to specify paths to a few
                different versions of the font, as shown on the next page.</p>
            <li><h3>format:</h3></li>
            <p>This specifies the format that the font is supplied in. Many typeface makers do not allow you to use their fonts in this way, but there are open
                source fonts you can use freely. You can find lists of them at:</p>
