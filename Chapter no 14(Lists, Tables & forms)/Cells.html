        <h1>Border On Empty Cell</h1>
        <h2>empty-cell</h2>
        <p>If you have empty cells in your table, then you can use the empty-cells property to specify whether or not their borders should be shown.
            Since browsers treat empty cells in different ways, if you want to explicitly show or hide borders on any empty cells then you should
            use this property.</p>
        <ul>
            <p>It can take one of three values:</p>
            <li><h3>show</h3></li>
            <p>This shows the borders of any empty cells.</p>
            <li><h3>hide</h3></li>
            <p>This hides the borders of any empty cells.</p>
            <li><h3>inherit</h3></li>
            <p>If you have one table nested inside another, the inherit value instructs the table cells obey the rules of the containing table.</p>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example:-</h3>
        <table class="table-style-O">
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">1:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style">2:WK</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">3:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <table class="table-style-T">
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">1:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style">2:WK</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">3:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h1>Gap Between Cells</h1>
        <h2>border-spacing, border-collapse</h2>
        <p>The border-spacing property allows you to control the distance between adjacent cells. By default, browsers often leave a small gap between each table
            cell, so if you want to increase or decrease this space then the border-spacing property allows you to control the gap.</p>
        <p>The value of this property is usually specified in pixels. You can specify two values if desired to specify separate numbers for horizontal and
            vertical spacing. When a border has been used on table cells, where two cells meet, the width of lines would be twice that of the outside edges.
            It is possible to collapse adjacent borders to prevent this using the border-collapse property. Possible values are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>collapse:</b> Borders are collapsed into a single border where possible. (border-spacing will be ignored and cells pushed together, and
                empty-cells properties will be ignored.)</li>
            <li><b>separate:</b> Borders are detached from each other. (border-spacing and empty-cells will be obeyed.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Example:-</h3>
        <table class="table-seperate">
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">1:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style">2:WK</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">3:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style">4:WK</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <table class="table-collapse">
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">1:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style">2:WK</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="td-style">3:WK</td>
                <td class="td-style">4:WK</td>
            </tr>
