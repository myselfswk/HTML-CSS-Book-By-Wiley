        <h1>Styling Forms</h1>
        <!--Nobody I know enjoys filling in forms, so if you can make yours look more attractive and easier to use, more people are likely to fill it in.
            Also, when you come to look at a form in a few different browsers (as shown on the right), you will see that each browser displays them differently.
            CSS is commonly used to control the appearance of form elements. This is both to make them more attractive and to make them more consistent
            across different browsers-->
        <h2>Styling Text Inputs</h2>
        <p>This example demonstrates the CSS properties commonly used with text inputs, most of which you have already met. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>font-size</b> sets the size of the text entered by the user.</li>
            <li><b>color</b> sets the text color, and <b>background-color</b> sets the background color of the input.</li>
            <li><b>border</b> adds a border around the edge of the input box, and <b>border-radius</b> can be used to create rounded corners (for browsers
                that support this property).</li>
            <li>The <b>:focus</b> pseudo-class is used to change the background color of the text input when it is being used, and the <b>:hover</b>
                psuedo-class applies the same styles when the user hovers over them.</li>
            <li><b>background-image</b> adds a background image to the box. Because there is a different image for each input, we are using an attribute selector
                looking for the value of the id attribute on each input.</li>
        </ul>
        <input type="text" class="input-text email">
        <input type="text" class="input-text twitter">
        <input type="text" class="input-text web">

        <h1>Styling Submit Buttons</h1>
        <p>Here are some properties that can be used to style submit buttons</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>color</b> is used to change the color of the text on the button.</li>
            <li><b>text-shadow</b> can give a 3D look to the text in browsers that support this property.</li>
            <li><b>border-bottom</b> has been used to make the bottom border of the button slightly thicker, which gives it a more 3D feel</li>
            <li><b>background-color</b> can make the submit button stand out from other items around it. </li>
            <li>The <b>:hover</b> pseudo-class has been used to change the appearance of the button when the user hovers over it. In this case, the
                background changes, the text gets darker, and the thicker border is applied to the top of the button.</li>
        </ul>
        <input type="button" class="input-button" value="Submit">
