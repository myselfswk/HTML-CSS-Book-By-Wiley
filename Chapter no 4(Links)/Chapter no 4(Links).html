        <!--Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing
        or surfing.-->
        <h1>Links:-</h1>
        <p>You will commonly come across the following types of links:-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Links from one website to another.</li>
            <li>Links from one page to another on the same website</li>
            <li>Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page</li>
            <li>Links that open in a new browser window</li>
            <li>Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Writing Links:-</h1>
        <!--Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify 
        which page you want to link to using the href attribute-->
        <!--a is anchor tag and domain name is basically url-->
        <!--The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text.-->

        <!--Many people navigate websites by scanning the text for links. Clear link text can help visitors find what they want. -->
        <!--To write good link text, you can think of words people might use when searching for the page that you are linking to. -->
        <dl>
            <dt>Absolute URL:-</dt>
            <dd>
                When you link to a different website, the value of the href attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an
                absolute URL.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site, and can be followed by the path to a specific page. If no page is specified,
                the site will display the homepage.

            <dd>
                When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You can use a
                shorthand known as a relative URL.

            <dd>
                When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute URLs because
                you do not need to specify the domain name.
            </dd>
            <dt>Example:-</dt>

        in relation to the current page. -->
        <!--On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the pages for each different section of the site into a new folder.

                The top-level folder is known as the root folder. The root folder contains all of the other files and folders for a website.

            <dd>Each section of the site is placed in a separate folder; this helps organize the files.</dd>
            <dt>Relationship:-</dt>
            <dd>
                The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.
